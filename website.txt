<b>>>> Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science <!-- laglaglaglag --> | Teaching Assistant <!-- laglaglaglag --> | July 2020 - January 2021</b>
o <!-- laglaglaglag --> Lead recitations of 20-30 students and teach JavaScript to help students 
to apply computer science to showcase their artistic ability.
o <!-- laglaglaglag --> Host office hours and extra help sessions to help students with concepts taught 
in lecture and with their assignments and their independent projects.
<br/>
<b>>>> Carnegie Mellon Computing Services <!-- laglaglaglag --> | Network Operation Student Tech <!-- laglaglaglag --> | January 2020 - June 2020</b>
o <!-- laglaglaglag --> Responsible for activating and cabling network ports and assisting 
with network management projects.    
<br/>
<b>>>> Stevens Institute of Technology <!-- laglaglaglag --> | Research Assistant <!-- laglaglaglag --> | June 2019 - August 2019</b>
o <!-- laglaglaglag --> Designed a program to measure the 3D motions (especially heave) of the watercraft 
with Arduino for Dr. Furth’s naval engineering research.
o <!-- laglaglaglag --> Utilized Arduinor UNO to simultaneously transport the inertial measurement unit (IMU) data over wifi.
 
 ***IMU Data: included 3-d motions as well as heave motion specific to watercrafts -- to study the most 
    efficient way to decrease water resistance.

<b>>>> Computer System Assignments | September 2020 – December 2020 </b>
<span class="tab"></span> o Created various projects such as a malloc program that was more efficient than current malloc library in C,
<span class="tab"></span> a project that created buffer overflows to “attack” programs, a cache simulator project, a project with a
<span class="tab"></span> concurrent proxy server. 

<b>>>> Faux Temple Run Game (112 Run) | May 2020 </b>
<span class="tab"></span> o Created my own version of Temple Run by learning and incorporating new python libraries such as
<span class="tab"></span> pygame in less than a month – this experience helped me build skills to work in a fast-paced environment.

<b>>>> Logic Gates Helper (Computer Engineering Educational Tool) | December 2020 </b>
<span class="tab"></span> o Applied my knowledge in Electrical and Computer Engineering and designed a program in Python that
<span class="tab"></span> shows how NAND and NOR gates can be used to build any logic expression.
