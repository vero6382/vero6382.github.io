Hi, my name is Sun A Cho (sunac). <!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --> I am currently a sophomore pursuing double majors in 
Electrical & Computer Engineering and Engineering & Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA).
Outside of classroom, I am actively involved in the Student Government, both in Joint-Funding Committee and Student Senate.
In both sectors of Student Government, I am in charge of student activities fund.

<b>>>> Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science <!-- laglaglaglag --> | Teaching Assistant <!-- laglaglaglag --> | July 2020 - January 2021</b>
&emsp;o <!-- laglaglaglag --> Self-taught Javascript and p5js library to work as a Teaching Assistant.
&emsp;o <!-- laglaglaglag --> Lead recitations of 20-30 students and teach JavaScript to help student
&emsp;  to apply computer science to showcase their artistic ability.
&emsp;o <!-- laglaglaglag --> Host office hours and extra help sessions to help students with concepts taught
&emsp;  in lecture and with their assignments and their independent projects.

<b>>>> Carnegie Mellon Computing Services <!-- laglaglaglag --> | Network Operation Student Tech <!-- laglaglaglag --> | January 2020 - June 2020</b>
&emsp;o <!-- laglaglaglag --> Responsible for activating and cabling network ports and assisting 
&emsp;  with network management projects.    

<b>>>> Stevens Institute of Technology <!-- laglaglaglag --> | Research Assistant <!-- laglaglaglag --> | June 2019 - August 2019</b>
&emsp;o <!-- laglaglaglag --> Designed a program to measure the 3D motions (especially heave) of the watercraft 
&emsp;  with Arduino for Dr. Furth’s naval engineering research.
&emsp;o <!-- laglaglaglag --> Utilized Arduinor UNO to simultaneously transport the inertial measurement unit (IMU) data over wifi.
 
&emsp; ***IMU Data: included 3-d motions as well as heave motion specific to watercrafts -- to study the most 
&emsp; efficient way to decrease water resistance. More details can be found here: <a href="https://www.furthlab.com/">Furth_Lab_Website</a>

<b>>>> Computer System Assignments | September 2020 – December 2020 </b>
&emsp;o Created various projects such as a malloc program that was more efficient than current malloc library in C,
&emsp;  a project that created buffer overflows to “attack” programs, a cache simulator project, a project with a
&emsp;  concurrent proxy server.

<b>>>> Faux Temple Run Game (112 Run) | May 2020 </b>
&emsp;o Created my own version of Temple Run by learning and incorporating new python libraries such as
&emsp;  pygame in less than a month – this experience helped me build skills to work in a fast-paced environment.

<b>>>> Logic Gates Helper (Computer Engineering Educational Tool) | December 2020 </b>
&emsp;o Applied my knowledge in Electrical and Computer Engineering and designed a program in Python that
&emsp;  shows how NAND and NOR gates can be used to build any logic expression.
